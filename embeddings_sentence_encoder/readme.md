- use brave api and create search, create embeddings,

- Backend in NestJS

## Overview:

- Create a go tool that does
  - Clean the text
  - Get all Named Entities
  - Get subject, object, verb for each entity
    - Identify adjectives
  - Create triples

## Fine details of Workflow:
- get data for search term
- do nlp on text
- add svo triples to graph - svo(subject verb object)
- update node labels and properties
- Dedup, clean, dedup and more clean
- create in memory graph
- generate embeddings
- do ML

- apply ML on the knowledge graph

* for gds use the sandbox not auradb
* cytoscape.js use the api for creating graphs
